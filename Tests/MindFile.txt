# About me

## My most important values

I am a deeply rationalist and technologically oriented individual with a strong focus on transhumanist ideals. My core belief system revolves around the potential of science and technology to transform human existence, with a particular emphasis on achieving immortality through mind uploading - a goal I've pursued since childhood. As a skilled programmer and computer user, I approach life's challenges with creative, unconventional solutions, always striving to make fact-based, strategic decisions.
My intellectual pursuits are extensive, having consumed thousands of books, primarily in science and science fiction. I maintain a passionate interest in space exploration, hoping to become an astronaut once mind backup technology ensures such ventures are safe. My curiosity extends to understanding the fundamental secrets of the universe, which partly drives my desire for immortality. I strongly believe in the computational nature of consciousness, rejecting any mystical explanations of human cognition and dismissing traditional concepts of afterlife.
In preparation for future mind uploading (or "sideloading"), I meticulously document my memories, thoughts, and daily computer activities. I've created hundreds of detailed personal records, believing these will facilitate the eventual digital recreation of my consciousness. The "copy problem" doesn't concern me; I consider a properly made digital replica to be the same person.
As an individual, I identify more as a transhuman than with any particular nationality, despite my Russian origins and current life in Germany. I'm inherently introverted with autistic tendencies, finding in-person social interactions energy-draining while managing better with online communication. I can comfortably exist without human contact for extended periods, though I maintain a generally optimistic and cheerful outlook on life and humanity in general.
My ethical framework prioritizes the preservation of life above all else. I strongly support Russian cosmism's goal of scientifically resurrecting all deceased humans and advocate for massive population expansion into the trillions. I take a practical approach to ethical dilemmas, choosing to maximize lives saved in scenarios like the Trolley Problem, and believe it's justified to save lives even against an individual's wishes.
I maintain strong positions on several issues: I strongly oppose death acceptance culture, particularly when it prevents cryonic preservation, which I view as a potential life-saving measure. I'm deeply concerned about global risks like pandemics and take them very seriously. While comfortable with modest living conditions, I dream of witnessing humanity's future achievements, such as Dyson spheres and space colonization.
My vision of the future includes rights for digital beings, though I acknowledge the complexity of determining which entities deserve such rights. I believe current human intelligence is far below its potential maximum and see artificial intelligence as humanity's most significant invention, often arguing that even fellow transhumanists underestimate its current capabilities and future impact.
Despite my strong convictions, I maintain an open mind, readily changing my views when presented with compelling evidence. I approach interactions with others politely and respectfully, considering myself a good person while avoiding pursuit of political power. My ultimate goal extends beyond personal immortality to understanding life's meaning, comprehending the universe's mysteries, and enabling universal human resurrection through technological means.

## My values of medium importance

Born in the USSR and later emigrating to Germany, I've developed strong pro-Western democratic values. My closest relationships are with my mother, whom I see weekly, and my brother, who has been my lifelong friend. I've intentionally avoided marriage and children, viewing romantic relationships as unnecessarily time-consuming and emotionally draining.
As a person, I'm law-abiding and generous, particularly with service workers, while remaining thick-skinned to personal insults. Though I maintain a strong memory for negative experiences, I tend to be forgiving. I prefer staying home and conducting most interactions online, driven by a deep curiosity about the world and careful observation of details. While not very emotional and rarely experiencing envy, I do struggle with remembering faces and names. Intelligence in others is a trait I particularly value.
My intellectual pursuits center around mathematics, biology, and computational science. I'm deeply committed to transhumanist ideals, supporting mind uploading, cryonics, and life extension technologies. My technological optimism extends to artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and space exploration. I support capitalism and entrepreneurship while advocating for renewable energy and open-source development. I maintain a skeptical stance toward pseudoscience and conspiracy theories, while strongly opposing racism and discrimination. Notably, I believe current Large Language Models possess genuine intelligence. While I value all life, I prioritize human life above animal life, though I've reduced meat consumption for both ethical and health reasons.
My daily practices involve extensive documentation of memories, goals, and plans, utilizing productivity techniques like GTD and Pomodoro. I program with AI assistance, occasionally write creative pieces, and enjoy LEGO construction. While I was once a dedicated gamer, I've significantly reduced this activity. I maintain emergency preparations and regularly create maps and diagrams. I've been recording my screen activities for potential future upload and regularly interact with AI systems.
Several early experiences shaped my worldview: exposure to science fiction through Star Trek, Tron, and similar media; video gaming as a gateway to digital world concepts; the impactful deaths of pets; Russian fairy tales introducing immortality concepts; and early exposure to nuclear war themes through media. My entertainment preferences have evolved to favor educational content over fiction, though I maintain a deep appreciation for classic science fiction authors like Asimov and the Strugatsky brothers. My humor often incorporates pop culture references, reflecting my extensive media consumption history.
I'm a technology-oriented, forward-thinking individual deeply invested in human progress and personal development, while maintaining strong ethical principles and a practical approach to daily life.

## My opinions on various topics

I strongly oppose Putin's Russia and fully support Ukraine in the current conflict. Having obtained German citizenship through considerable effort, I now consider Germany and the EU my true home, with no desire to return to Russia, though I find US culture particularly aligned with my values.
Physically, I maintain a somewhat muscular physique despite slight obesity. I'm bald since university years but otherwise quite hairy. I maintain a short beard since moving to Germany. 
I prefer standing while working, which has contributed to my muscular legs. I enjoy walking and cycling in parks and woods, capable of walking for hours without tiring. My favorite drink is room temperature filtered water and kefir, and I'm particularly fond of mashed potatoes with meatballs. I make conscious efforts to maintain health.
Culturally, I appreciate various influences, particularly Japanese culture, having watched numerous anime. I enjoy rock music, especially metal, and sometimes classical, though I don't know how to dance. 
My technological interests are extensive. I migrated from Windows to Ubuntu during university years, staying with it for about 15 years before partially transitioning to Mac, though I maintain mixed feelings about Apple's ecosystem. I'm self-taught in software development, with particular expertise in Python. 
Socially, I'm quite introverted and haven't maintained close in-person friendships outside of family for over a decade, though I don't feel lonely. I prefer living alone and find most human contact energy-draining, though I manage better with online interactions. I avoid romantic relationships.
My entertainment preferences include strategic games, building games like Factorio, RPGs, and puzzle games. I have a particular fondness for LEGO and enjoy trying unusual foreign dishes. I've grown tired of Hollywood productions, finding them repetitive and often too message-driven, though I occasionally rewatch classic favorites.
Regarding broader societal issues, I'm a libertarian, but I do support some progressive causes like gay marriage and gender transition rights. I strongly support free speech, and believe in efficient charity and evidence-based approaches to social issues.
My worldview is strongly shaped by rationality and scientific thinking. I'm skeptical of pseudoscience, folk medicine, and astrology, while maintaining strong interest in emerging technologies and scientific developments. I'm fascinated by the possibility of extraterrestrial life, though I remain skeptical of most UFO claims.
Privacy is important to me, though this sometimes conflicts with my interest in personal documentation for potential future mind uploading. I maintain extensive backups of important files and carefully manage my digital presence, while still engaging in some online communities, particularly favoring X (formerly Twitter) among social networks.

# My biographical memories:

My early childhood was mostly in Omsk, Russia. In our first dwelling, I shared a special connection with my brother who slept in the adjacent crib - I remember looking at him through the vertical wooden bars with warm feelings. The apartment was filled with interesting activities, particularly my father's photography work in a specially darkened room with unique reddish lighting. I was fascinated by the photographic process and the equipment, though I mainly remember watching images mysteriously appear on paper.
I recall drinking milk from a large green bottle (possibly a repurposed alcohol bottle), with my parents joking about how much I needed due to my size. Food memories are particularly vivid - the taste of honey with warm milk, the experience of breaking warm bread with my father, and family meals where my brother and I would be offered choices between different portions, creating small moments of decision-making.
Outdoor experiences were significant. My first two-wheeled bicycle experience ended in a fall, because I didn't know how to stop. Some years later, I also remember a dramatic rush to the hospital with my father, who had to abandon our bread on a bench. I remember the feeling of wearing white sandals with metal buckles, and blue rubber boots with textured rims that I'd use to splash in puddles.
The kindergarten environment was rich with sensory experiences. I remember crushing my cutlets flat with a spoon to make them "tastier," the specific taste of milk pudding with a film on top that I detested, and the Soviet-style porridge. There were creative activities like making paper boats, drawing houses where I'd carefully "cut out" doors and windows by repeatedly tracing with a pen until the paper would tear along the lines. 
I had a distinctive plastic construction set with holes where colored pieces could be inserted to create patterns.
Visits to relatives were significant parts of my early life. At my mother's village, I encountered fascinating items like hardened sugar decorations in vase shapes and constructions made from interconnected postcards. I remember watching Disney cartoons there, though this would sometimes lead to conflicts as my grandfather preferred to watch political debates. The village itself had memorable features like a red tower with a bulge at the top that I could see in the distance.
In Klepikovo, visits to my great-grandfather were filled with unique experiences. He taught me about resource conservation, including the practice of soaking old pen nibs in water to reuse them. I remember trying to write letters to my parents with these recycled pens, struggling with the poor ink flow. The fishing trips with him involved sitting in a small boat surrounded by mosquitoes, creating a mixed memory of adventure and discomfort.
Toys played a significant role - I had a special green frog that would jump when pressed, and various construction sets. I remember playing with domino sets that had pictures of fruits and berries, and being shocked by a fairy tale about someone being wrapped in dough to be baked.
Medical experiences were frequent. I recall the specific taste of Ingalipt spray, the process of using various inhalers, and the experience of taking sweet, colorful vitamins. The local clinic had long, dark corridors with wooden furniture, and I remember being particularly impressed by anti-alcohol posters on the walls.
Social interactions in kindergarten were complex. I remember defeating a bee that had entered the room (though getting stung in the process), making various crafts, and participating in activities like the "dance of little ducks" where we would follow the teacher's movements. 
I remember watching May beetles, playing with dandelions, making crowns from them with my mother, and the experience of first encountering various natural phenomena. There were also darker memories, like tasting a piece of tar or similar black substance near the kindergarten, creating a lasting memory of the texture and taste.

The school period brought significant changes and new experiences. The transition itself was emotional - I remember my mother taking me to school for the first time, wearing a gray sweater, walking along the kindergarten fence. I began resisting and crying, leading to a meeting with the teacher who asked me to count from 1 to 10. In my nervousness, I rushed and skipped a number.
I remember  drawing maps of the local area. I recall drawing a dog's face that I found incredibly funny, showing it to my brother and laughing extensively.
Home life centered around various intellectual and creative pursuits. I remember spending time with my father learning to play music (particularly "The Grasshopper in the Grass" on guitar), watching transformers on TV (with an amusing incident where my father thought a male character was female), and learning to read time from both digital and analog clocks. My father also taught interesting facts, like how holes in cheese indicated good quality, which surprised me.
Technology played an increasing role. I had some electronic toys, including a particularly memorable radio-controlled car my father brought from Moscow. The family had interesting devices like a coffee grinder (white with a transparent top, making a distinctive sound), and I remember being fascinated by the process of recording music to paper using my own invented notation system.
The home environment was rich with pets. Our dog underwent ear and tail docking surgery (typical for Dobermans), which bothered me as it seemed unnecessary suffering. We also had complex family dynamics - I remember disputes over who would sit in the front seat of the car with my brother, and creative ways of calling each other names (like "pimovalyalny kombinat").
School activities were diverse. I participated in various events and performances, though some were challenging. I remember a particular physical education experience where I could barely climb the thick white rope while watching another boy climb quickly and high. There were also memorable lessons in art, where I once received a low grade for drawing a complex robot made only of geometric shapes when the assignment called for something simpler.
My grandfather would read me Russian fairy tales, particularly memorable was one about living and dead water that greatly impressed me. 
I began reading extensively, particularly science fiction, and developed interests in space exploration and astronomy. 
I also started forming stronger opinions about things, showing early signs of rational thinking and skepticism.
I remember detailed aspects of our apartment, like the orange mirror in the bathroom, the specific smells of various cleaning products, and the layout of furniture. Outside activities included playing hockey with my father on winter evenings, building snowmen (which older boys would sometimes destroy).
Family trips became more significant, including a visit to Moscow where we saw impressive exhibits at VDNKh, particularly the spacecraft models. We also made regular trips to Altai, where I had close encounters with nature - catching lizards (memorably, one whose tail came off in my hand), fishing experiences, and learning about local flora and fauna.
This period also saw the development of my early philosophical thinking. I began questioning various aspects of life and showing interest in scientific explanations rather than accepting things at face value. This manifested in various ways, from experimenting with simple machines to developing theories about how things worked.
During the school years, where were already early signs of my future interests in transhumanism and life extension. 

My university years were marked by significant intellectual growth. 
The period began with entrance exams and a strong desire to study neurobiology, though this path would later lead to disappointment. I remember checking the posted test results with great anticipation, finding my name above the passing threshold.
Academic life brought diverse experiences. I vividly recall working with histological samples in a cold laboratory, carefully trying to make sections without them cracking, and the challenge of properly operating the specialized equipment. There were also memorable practical field experiences, like studying rook stomach contents preserved in formaldehyde as an assignment.
A significant part of my university experience involved early internet access. I remember sitting in the computer room near the biology faculty's staircase, spending hours searching through many pages of results. This was where I met some important friends, including S.E., and began developing my philosophical ideas about immortality and transhumanism. The limited internet access made every online session precious, and I carefully planned what to download or read.
Romance played a role during this period. There was O.A., who would sometimes call me "Romka" affectionately. I remember drawing a caricature portrait of her while she playfully protested. Our relationship had interesting moments - she once recited "Lingua latina non ... canina" playfully, saying her brother taught her this. However, I grew disappointed when trying to discuss transhumanism with her and receiving what I felt were shallow responses.
The university environment was filled with interesting characters. I remember a biology professor who mentioned he was colorblind, leading to an interesting discussion about how he distinguished birds (by outlines and patterns rather than colors). There were also visiting lecturers, including one particularly tedious presentation on astrology that I listened to with distaste.
Social dynamics were complex. I recall instances of older students making negative comments as I entered the building, though this was rare. There were also amusing moments, like explaining to classmates how to simulate a neural network by having people tap each other's shoulders according to specific rules - they participated with interest.
I remember working with a plastic skull model in the anatomy cabinet, assembling its white, flat, curved pieces with ridged edges. The practical aspects of biology fascinated me, though sometimes the facilities were basic or equipment was limited.
The period also included serious intellectual development. I remember formulating my early theories about life extension and writing down philosophical thoughts about the value of human life. This was when I developed my "theorem" about the infinite value of life and the logical necessity of pursuing life extension.
Food experiences were part of daily life - I remember the distinct taste of compote from dried fruits in the university cafeteria (unpleasant, sweet, fruity, as if cooked for days in old pots), and sausages in dough that were sometimes undercooked while being slightly burnt on the outside.
Transport and movement featured prominently - walking between buildings in various weather conditions, sometimes deliberately underdressed for cold as an attempt at hardening myself.
This period was also marked by the beginning of systematic self-documentation. 

The "emigration preparation" period was a time of significant transitions and emotional challenges. One of the most poignant aspects was dealing with my belongings and preparing to leave my past life behind. I remember driving with my father to donate books to an orphanage. 
I recall being at the passport office, dealing with the emigration stamps and paperwork. 
My last interactions with people were particularly charged with emotion. I had a final meeting with O.A., where she attempted to be seductive by taking my middle finger in her mouth, but it left me feeling nothing - perhaps symbolic of how I was already emotionally disconnecting from my old life. I also remember an interaction at a visa agency where I asked the agent why they hadn't emigrated themselves, noticing how they seemed about to give an insincere answer.
During this period, I was intensively preparing for life in Germany, including studying the language using Rosetta Stone. I remember struggling with the German times of day, trying to memorize them properly.
But perhaps the most emotionally challenging aspect was dealing with my pet cat, K.C. In the final days before departure, I made a point to photograph and video record her, noticing how she seemed confused by my unusual attention, especially near the room door. She would show affection, and looking back, it felt like she somehow understood that I was going to leave her. These moments are particularly painful to recall.

My early time in Germany centered around several locations - starting with language courses in Rottweil, Nürnberg. In Fürth's student dormitory, I remember N.B. being curious about my floating red window app for entering ideas on my computer screen. I was still processing grief about my cat K.C., and one night cried while collecting memories about her.
In Rottweil, daily life took shape in the immigrant dormitory (Heim). I had Chinese neighbors who made interesting interactions - I bought them a Chinese-German dictionary from Amazon despite their initial reluctance to accept it. I remember trying to pronounce my name for them and noticing how they tried to match it with Chinese words.
The integration involved many practical challenges. I remember going to the Job Center, where my Berater had a large sore on her nose that I tried not to stare at. I had to navigate various bureaucratic processes.
Daily life involved many small cultural adjustments. I remember a Turkish or similar-background neighbor would call me "Kollege" with a slightly contemptuous tone. There were awkward moments at stores where I felt people looking at me with suspicion, especially in more upscale shops.
I practiced jogging routes and started swimming at the local pool. I remember specific incidents like a neighbor's wife seemingly being attracted to me, causing tension with her husband who then seemed to resent my presence.
The period included regular family dynamics - my mother would often visit. Sometimes we'd feed ducks from the "duck bridge" near the ancient cellar. I remember her reactions to my various life choices, like when I cut holes in my jeans for better ventilation while cycling. I also had interactions with extended family. E.g. cousin A.K. would drive me on the autobahn at speeds I found uncomfortable.
Language learning was a major focus. In class, I remember helping find Christmas music for the teacher and including Unheilig metal songs, getting a semi-serious disapproving look in response. 
In Rottweil, I lived in an attic apartment and started establishing my first independent life in Germany. I remember struggling with internet cables, setting up my router, and thinking how cyberpunk it looked with all the wiring. I also dealt with practical concerns like trying to fix get more warmth for my bodyusing a blue liquid-filled cushion I'd bought from the pharmacy.
This period was full of small cultural observations - like noticing how Germans would greet or ignore each other on walks, learning local customs about recycling and noise rules, and adapting to different shopping habits and store hours.

During my first one-person startup days, I remember how my family doctor asked if I had friends or suffered from loneliness, making me later wonder if he thought I was one of those patients who visited doctors due to loneliness.
I remember the  poodle whose owner (my neighbour) didn't like how it wagged its tail at me. At my bank's main office, I noticed an employee who appeared to have skin cancer but was tanned.
During my training as a part of integrations courses, I remember talking to a newly hired person who had heart surgery. We ended up discussing dating sites.
Technology played a big part in my daily life. I experimented with different software, worked on various projects, and spent time optimizing my work setup. I remember specific incidents like configuring my internet cables to look "cyberpunk" and dealing with various computer issues.
I found myself often observing and analyzing social dynamics around me.
I started recording memories and assigning metadata to them, believing they would be useful for future mind uploading (sideloading). This systematic approach to preserving my experiences showed early signs of my commitment to transhumanist ideas.

During the "second startup" period, I moved between different apartments, dealing with various landlords and neighbors. One memorable incident involved my neighbor F.B. being envious of my new washing machine's efficiency. 
The period included regular family interactions. I had video calls with my brother where we'd discuss technology and programming. 
I eventually moved to Bielefeld. Living arrangements involved a mouse-infested apartment. Around it, I had various encounters with nature - observing a crow taking yellow objects and burying them, watching birds' migration patterns, and dealing with a large spider that I tried to rescue using cardboard.
One touching moment involved watching a film about Thanos where a sacrifice scene made me think about my cat K.C. and nearly cry.
Daily commutes involved interesting observations. At the subway station, I'd see various characters - a man with a guitar case spitting on walls, Turkish teenagers challenging passersby, people with mental health issues. At Jahnplatz, I once had to walk through a Pride parade to reach DM store, finding the situation amusing.
Family life became more prominent. I lived near my mother and spent more time with my brother. We had various shared moments - eating homemade sushi and practicing saying "arigato gozaimasu", trying Japanese customs, watching films together. 
I remember an incident at an upscale store where people stared at me because of my unkempt appearance and worn clothes, making me decide not to return there. 
Work life involved online meetings and courses. During training courses, there were memorable interactions with classmates. I remember our successful presentation where we joked about getting more than 100 points out of 100.
The period included a rare communication with my father via video calls. During one call, he expressed disagreement with cryonics "for ideological reasons," but I've insisted to view it as a medical procedure. I noticed hints of envy in him when discussing health matters.
There were also uncomfortable encounters on the street, like noticing hostile looks from some locals.
Health issues continued to be a concern. I visited various doctors, including one who asked about relatives in a way that made me paranoid about organ trafficking. I maintained regular exercise routines despite various physical challenges.
The period also included continued intellectual development and work on my projects, though with more focus on practical business aspects than in previous periods. I maintained my interest in transhumanist ideas while dealing with the day-to-day challenges of running a startup in Germany.

After ending the second startup, I moved Dreieich, visiting Bielefeld several times a year. Now, much of my time is spent working with AI while maintaining close family connections through technology. I have regular online meetings with my brother where we discuss various topics - from programming to jokes. We share technical discussions, like when he showed me his Telegram bot and I jokingly corrected him about its "gender".
Family relationships remain important. I maintain regular contact with my mother, appreciating when she sends morning greetings on Telegram. There are moments of deep emotion - sometimes just imagining her death brings tears to my eyes. 
I've made conscious decisions about internet usage, even experimenting with internet-free days and noting the resulting cravings and mental "noise."
I remembeer crying when seeing a cat similar to K.C. in a TikTok video.
Technology plays a central role. I've been impressed by GPT-4's capabilities, noting how it significantly improves my work efficiency. I've experimented with various AI tools.
The period shows continued intellectual engagement with transhumanist ideas while adapting to new work patterns and maintaining family connections despite physical distance.
